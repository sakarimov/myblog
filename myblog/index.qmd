## Welcome. Peace be upon you.

This is my little corner of the web where I share thoughts, projects, and lessons from my journey as a programmer, builder, and believer.

I used to hold back from sharing, afraid of saying the wrong thing or not being “good enough.” But I realized: growth happens when we share — not when we're perfect, but when we're sincere.

Inspired by the example of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, who shared truth with wisdom and humility, I hope to offer what I can, no matter how small. Whether it’s a piece of code, a reflection, or a simple idea — I share it here with the hope that it brings benefit.

“Convey from me, even if it is one verse.” — Prophet Muhammad ﷺ

If something here helps you, inspires you, or even makes you curious, alhamdulillah.
If not, that’s okay too — I’m still learning, still growing, and I’m grateful you stopped by.

Bismillah — let’s build, reflect, and learn together.

**— Sulthan A. Karimov —**
